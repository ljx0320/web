## This is a summary of all the html files
Basically they are all quizzes.

First of all, learned the boilerplate.

1. [html_list_assignment.html](https://github.com/ljx0320/web/blob/master/HTML/html_list_assignment.html) uses **ol ul li** tags

2. [recreate_webpage_assignment.html](https://github.com/ljx0320/web/blob/master/HTML/recreate_webpage_assignment.html) uses **img src** and **a href**

3. [pokemon.html](https://github.com/ljx0320/web/blob/master/HTML/pokemon.html) uses tags about tables like **table** **tr** **td**

4. [form_assignment.html](https://github.com/ljx0320/web/blob/master/HTML/form_assignment.html) is kind of hard and very important. This uses tags including ```form``` ```label``` ```select```. Different ```input type``` including ```password``` ```email```. Try to see the html and think some important tags to implement this!
